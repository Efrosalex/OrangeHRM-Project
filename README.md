This repository contains **automated functional and regression tests** for **OrangeHRM**, using **Playwright** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.  
It covers **employee management, leave requests, maintenance access, Buzz posts, and timesheet management**, including both **employee and manager workflows**.
